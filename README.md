# KLE Converter

This is a npm library that helps to convert the serialized format of KLE (Keyboard Layout Editor) to a easier to use format and back. The code is based on the MIT licensed code from Ian Prest in https://github.com/ijprest/kle-serial. Originally this repo was a fork, but over time it has been modified to the point that it is no longer a fork. The `kle-serial` lib only provides deserialization and does not merge PRs that fix some issues. Files from the original repo still contain the original license.
